# @theia-shell/theia-file-panels

Midnight-Commander-style file panels for the theia-shell app: one-folder views in the main area,
a breadcrumb whose segments list their sibling folders, the explorer's file commands, and
copy/move by drag and drop and by menu commands. Design:
[`docs/specs/2026-09-26-file-panels-design.md`](../../docs/specs/2026-09-26-file-panels-design.md).

## Entry points

A private package of this workspace (not published). Theia loads it through
the `theiaExtensions` entry of its `package.json`; it is used by the app.

- `main`: `lib/common/index.js`: the breadcrumb model, sorting, formats, the transfer planner and runner, the messages (`file-panels-nls.ts`) and the locale.
- `theiaExtensions`: `frontend` and `frontendOnly` → `lib/browser/file-panels-frontend-module`.

Build and test it with `pnpm --filter @theia-shell/theia-file-panels build` and
`pnpm --filter @theia-shell/theia-file-panels test`.

## Opening a panel

- **View → Open Files Panel** (also in the command palette) opens a panel at the first workspace
  root — in this app, where every mount is a workspace root, the main storage ("Browser
  Storage").
- **Open in Files Panel**, on the explorer's context menu for a folder (or for a file → its
  parent folder), opens one there.
- A new panel opens **split to the right** of the current panel; from anywhere else, as a tab in
  the main area.

## The panel

One folder, flat: folders first, then files, sorted by the active column — name (with
`Intl.Collator`, `file2` before `file10`), size or modified — ascending or descending; clicking a
column header sorts by it, clicking again reverses. The column headings are an ARIA table
(`role="table"` > `role="row"` > `role="columnheader"` with `aria-sort`, a `<button>` inside each)
over Theia's own tree rows, not a literal `<table>`.

- **Toolbar**: Go Up, Refresh (tab-bar toolbar items, not buttons inside the panel). Each acts on
  the panel whose tab bar it sits on, even while the focus is elsewhere; Refresh on a folder that
  could not be opened tries to open it again. Go Up (and Backspace) stops at a workspace root:
  above the roots lies no workspace folder (here, the hidden read-only composite `file:///` that
  holds the mounts). Another root is one ▾ away, on the first breadcrumb segment.
- **Keys inside the list** are tree-local, not keybindings: arrows move, Shift/Ctrl extend the
  selection, Enter opens (folder → navigate, file → open), Backspace goes up. Typing a letter
  opens Theia's type-to-filter box; while it is open, Backspace edits the filter instead.
- **Opening a file** goes through Theia's own open handler, exactly as the explorer does — the
  editor lands in the panel's tab group, over the panel (Theia's normal tab behaviour;
  `FilePanelModel.doOpenNode` does not change it).
- **Freshness**: the tree refreshes on file-system change events for its folder. If the folder is
  deleted or renamed from elsewhere, the panel falls back to its nearest existing ancestor within
  its workspace root (or the first workspace root) and shows a short notice. A panel on a mount
  that is removed from the workspace goes to the first root, never above the roots.
- **Returning to the requested folder**: a fallback remembers the folder it could not reach and
  watches for it to exist again (a mount recreated after a vault unlock, a Reconnect, a mount
  added back to the workspace) — once it does within a workspace root, the panel returns there by
  itself, clearing the notice. It checks on a files change touching the folder and on a workspace
  change (a mount added back appears before the workspace lists it as a root). A folder outside
  every root (a layout stored at `file:///`) is never returned to. Navigating elsewhere by hand (a
  breadcrumb click, opening a folder in the list, Go Up, …) forgets it instead.
- **Live labels**: the breadcrumb, the tab title and the notice follow `LabelProvider.onDidChange`
  — a mount's "(locked)" / "(click Reconnect)" / "(unavailable: …)" suffix updates in place, with
  no navigation needed.
- **A folder that cannot be opened** (a locked mount, a read error — anything but "does not
  exist") never throws out of a navigation: the panel stays at that folder with an empty list and
  shows “{folder}” is not available: {reason} with **Retry**, which opens the same folder again.
  The breadcrumb, Go Up and the stored layout all keep that folder. A listing that fails on a
  later refresh shows the same way, not as a toast.
- The panel's layout (folder, sort) is restored after a reload. A restored folder — or the folder
  the panel was created at — that no longer exists falls back to its nearest existing ancestor
  with the notice; one that exists but cannot be read stays, as not available with Retry. A
  folder outside every workspace root (a layout stored before mounts became roots holds
  `file:///`) comes back at the first root, with the same notice. Either way the panel is never
  dropped from the layout.

## Breadcrumb

Segments run from the workspace root that contains the current folder down to it; clicking one
navigates there. An overflowing path collapses its middle segments into **…**, which opens a list
of the hidden ones.

Every segment has a **▾** that opens a popup of its **sibling folders** — read fresh on open, so
never stale — with the current one marked; for the first segment, the siblings are the workspace
roots — the mounts ("Browser Storage", "Temporary", …), each shown by its label — so a panel moves
between mounts from there; copies and moves between panels on different roots work like any other
(cross-mount, see Known limits). Arrows, Enter and Esc work in the popup; it closes on an outside
click or a focus change. Each segment is also a drop target, handled exactly as a drop on a folder
row; its drag events stop at the segment, so the main area's own drop handling (which would open
every dragged file in an editor, and whose `link` drop effect would cancel the drop) never sees
them.

## Drops and transfers

| Source ↓ · Target → | Into a panel | Into the explorer |
|---|---|---|
| From a panel | Dialog: Copy / Move / Rename | Theia's own rule — a plain drop moves, Ctrl (⌥ on macOS) copies, no dialog |
| From the explorer | Dialog: Copy / Move / Rename | Theia's own drop, unchanged |
| From the operating system | Uploaded, no dialog | Theia's own upload, unchanged |

- A drop **onto the source folder itself** never offers Move (moving something onto its own folder
  is meaningless): one item offers Copy and Rename; several items offer Copy only, each getting a
  free name. Dropping a folder onto itself or one of its own descendants is rejected with a
  warning instead, not offered in the dialog.
- **One item**: the name field's warning is literal — a typed name that already exists is
  replaced, also for a Copy inside the source's own folder.
- **Several items with a clash**: one choice for the batch — Overwrite, Keep both (free names) or
  Skip — shown with the clash count. Clashes **between the dropped sources themselves** never
  overwrite: under Overwrite the later one still gets a free name (overwriting something this same
  batch just wrote would lose data); under Keep both it also gets a free name; under Skip it is
  skipped.
- **Selection**: what a drop or Copy/Move to Other Panel wrote is selected in the target panel.
  Hovering a folder row during a drag does not change the selection.
- **Failures**: steps that fail do not stop the batch; one error lists them — “1 of 7 items
  failed” (plural on the total) and one “{name}: {reason}” line per item. A drop or transfer that
  fails as a whole (a resolve, an upload, a refresh) is logged and shown as one error; a
  cancellation is silent. No drop path leaves a rejected promise unhandled.
- **Uploads.** Theia's `FileUploadService` enumerates a drop through WebKit filesystem entries; a
  `DataTransfer` built without them (as any script-driven drop is) uploads nothing through that
  path, so `FileDropHandler` falls back to Theia's own exported `CustomDataTransfer`, built
  directly from the dropped files, whenever no entry resolves. A genuine OS drag keeps the native
  path, folder support included. Either way, Theia's own upload-complete handling auto-opens a
  single freshly uploaded file — true for any single-file upload anywhere in the app, not
  something this package can opt out of.
- **Drag payload**: `theia-editor-dnd` (Theia's own URI list, so editors, the shell and other
  panels all understand it) plus a panel-only marker, `theia-file-panels/uris`, by which the
  explorer recognises a panel drag. A browser clears a `DataTransfer` once the drop event's
  synchronous phase ends, so every drop handler in this package reads it in full **before its
  first `await`**.

## Context menu

- **Open** is the panel's own command, acting on the panel's selection (the navigator's own `Open`
  acts on the navigator's selection instead, which is why it is not reused here).
- **Open With…, Rename, Delete, New File, New Folder, Duplicate, Copy Path, Reveal in Explorer**
  are Theia's own commands, acting on the selection this panel publishes to `SelectionService` —
  their dialogs, confirmations and localization included.
- **Copy to Other Panel… / Move to Other Panel…**: enabled once another panel with a folder is
  open. With exactly one other panel it is the target; with more, a quick pick chooses one. Opens
  the same transfer dialog, preset to that choice; the results are selected in the target
  panel.
- The menu has its own path (`FILE_PANEL_CONTEXT_MENU`), independent of the explorer's layout.

## Extension rule

The explorer's own behaviour never changes; it gains exactly one case, a drag from a panel.
`PanelAwareNavigatorWidget extends FileNavigatorWidget` and overrides only the protected
`handleDropEvent`: with no panel marker in the drop it defers to `super.handleDropEvent`
untouched, so explorer→explorer drags and OS uploads are exactly as stock Theia; with the marker
present, it resolves the target and operation through the two other protected members it calls,
`getDropTargetDirNode` and `getDropEffect` (Ctrl/⌥ copies, otherwise moves), and carries it out
through the model's own public `copy`/`move` — no dialog. These three protected members of
`FileTreeWidget` are the whole of the **explorer extension's** reach into Theia.

The panel's own classes extend Theia's file tree the same way — exported classes, public or
protected members only, no private members, no copies of Theia internals:

- `FilePanelTreeWidget extends FileTreeWidget` overrides `onAfterAttach` (adds the Backspace
  listener through `addKeyListener`, reading the protected `searchBox`), `renderExpansionToggle`,
  `handleRight`, `getPaddingLeft`, `renderTailDecorations`, `handleDragStartEvent`,
  `handleDragEnterEvent`, `handleDragOverEvent` and `handleDropEvent`, and calls
  `getDropTargetDirNode` and `getDropEffect`.
- `FilePanelTree extends FileTree` overrides `resolveFileStat` and `toNodes`, using the protected
  `fileService`.
- `FilePanelModel extends FileTreeModel` overrides `doOpenNode`, using the protected
  `fileService` and the public `navigateTo` and `root`.
- `FilePanelWidget extends BaseWidget` overrides `onActivateRequest` and `onResize`.

## Internationalization

- Every user-visible string is a function in `src/common/file-panels-nls.ts` that calls
  `nls.localize("theia-shell/file-panels/<key>", "<English default>", ...)` with a string-literal
  key and default, so `theia nls-extract` can find it; no message is built by concatenation.
- Plural messages (item counts) pick a CLDR category with `Intl.PluralRules` and carry one literal
  key per category they can hit (`zero | one | two | few | many | other`); every category but
  `one` defaults to the same `other` English text.
- Counts inside messages (`Intl.NumberFormat`, so `1,200` in English), sizes
  (`Intl.NumberFormat`, `style: "unit"`), dates (`Intl.DateTimeFormat`) and name ordering
  (`Intl.Collator`) are formatted through `Intl`, not through message keys — they follow the
  platform's locale, not a translation catalog.
- **No translation provider yet**: browser-only Theia binds a stub `AsyncLocalizationProvider`
  that always resolves `en`. This package only guarantees every string is localizable; an actual
  non-English UI is separate, app-wide work.

## Known limits

- **Non-atomic cross-mount moves.** A move across mounts is copy-then-remove inside the composite
  file system, not a single operation; a failure partway through can leave a copy at the
  destination while the source still exists.
- **Only the explorer accepts a panel drag.** Other Theia file trees (the file-open dialog, the
  editor breadcrumb's folder popup) are not extended; dropping a panel row onto one does nothing,
  as today.
- **A mount that cannot be reached is read-only.** A mount that failed, is locked or awaits
  access is an empty read-only placeholder in the mount table; a panel lists it (empty) and every
  write into it fails, reported as for any failed transfer — the same as for the explorer.

## Notes

- The root `biome.json`'s `javascript.parser.unsafeParameterDecoratorsEnabled` (repo-wide) is needed for `FilePanelTreeWidget` and `PanelAwareNavigatorWidget`, whose
  constructors take `@inject(...)` parameters — not property injection like the rest of this
  package — because each must forward them to `super(props, model, contextMenuRenderer)`, exactly
  like the Theia classes they extend.
