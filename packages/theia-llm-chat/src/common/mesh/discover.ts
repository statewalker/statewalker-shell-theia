/**
 * Finding the hub's LLM service and turning its OpenAPI document into a chat endpoint.
 *
 * PURE AND FETCH-INJECTED, so it runs under Node in the unit tests. It imports nothing from
 * httpeers: the mesh view is taken by shape, and every call is a plain `fetch` to a URL under the
 * page's edge base, which the ServiceWorker routes over the mesh.
 *
 * WHAT IS READ FROM THE DOCUMENT (spec §5.6), and nothing is hard-coded instead:
 *   - `servers[0].url`, resolved against the document's own URL (the hub publishes `"."`), is the
 *     service base; the OpenAI-compatible base is that plus `v1`;
 *   - `components.securitySchemes.llmKey.name` is the header the key travels in;
 *   - `paths["/ui/"].get["x-httpeers-entry"]`, resolved against the service base, is the dashboard —
 *     and it is then clamped to the dashboard's own MOUNT (`<serviceBase>ui/`) when it points
 *     inside it, see `dashboardEntry`;
 *   - `paths["/keys"]` existing is what offers "Request a key". The call may still be refused.
 *
 * TRUST ONLY THE HUB. Any member can advertise `llm` on its heartbeat and serve its own document,
 * so discovery targets the hub's peer id and nothing else, and every URL the document yields —
 * the service base, the OpenAI base and the dashboard — must stay under `<edge><hubPeerId>/llm/`.
 * Otherwise a hostile `servers[0].url` (absolute, `../`, another peer) would receive the key.
