/**
 * The proxy page re-issues a mesh request to an outside origin. What leaves
 * must carry none of the mesh's own headers -- neither the membership token
 * nor the proven peer -- while the application's `Authorization` and the
 * route's typed credential go through.
 *
 * `urlUpstream` no longer drops `authorization` on its own (it belongs to the
 * application), so the mesh token staying home now depends entirely on this
 * page naming `MESH_CREDENTIAL_HEADERS`. A missing name would hand every
 * visitor's membership token to whatever origin a route points at.
