/*
 * PORTED from httpeers `apps/demos/src/shared/route-store.ts` (the proxy demo page), unchanged

 */

/**
 * WHERE THIS CAME FROM, AND WHY IT IS HERE. It shipped inside
 * `@statewalker/webrun-http-proxy` while that package also owned routing. It
 * does not any more: routing is a plain Hono router in `../proxy/main.ts`, and
 * the SHAPE of a persisted route is whoever defines the routes' business — so
 * the store came with them. The secret rule below is the part worth keeping.
 *
 * Original:
 * Persisting routes — and refusing, mechanically, to persist a secret.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE. A route may carry a credential: an
 * upstream API key, a bearer token, whatever the operator typed into the proxy
 * page. The header's NAME is configuration and is saved. The header's VALUE is
 * a secret, lives in memory, and is merged per request.
 *
 * That distinction cannot be left to callers. An earlier shape of this API
 * stored a whole `Route`, and building the proxy page on it would have written
 * bearer keys into `localStorage` — where they survive a reload, a shared
 * machine, and anyone who opens devtools. So `StoredRoute` has no field a
 * value could go in, and `save()` throws rather than silently dropping one:
 * silently dropping would mean a route that worked before a reload and
 * mysteriously 401s after it.
 *
 * `load()` RETURNS `undefined` FOR "NEVER WRITTEN", which is not the same as
 * an empty array and the difference is visible to a user. A first visit should
 * seed the demo routes; a visit after the operator deleted all of them should
 * not bring them back. One value distinguishes the two.
 */

 * A route as it is persisted: the upstream as a URL, and the header NAME only.

 * enforcement; `save()`'s check is the belt to its braces.
